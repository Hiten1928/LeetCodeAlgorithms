You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

Example 1:
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.



/**
 * @param {string} S
 * @param {number} K
 * @return {string}
 */
var licenseKeyFormatting = function(S, K) {
    S = S.replace(/-/g,'');
    const l = S.length;
    const f = (l % K === 0) ? K : l % K;
    let r = new Array();
    for (let i = f, j = 0; i <= l;j = i, i += K) {
        r.push(S.slice(j, i));
    }
    return r.join('-').toUpperCase();
};
